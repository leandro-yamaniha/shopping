# Fix iOS Build - Boost Checksum Issue

## Problem
```
Error installing boost
Verification checksum was incorrect, expected f0397ba6e982c4450f27bf32a2a83292aba035b827a5623a14636ea583318c41, got 07911da8fe22fb10e3918528a8f0a5676f03c0b3b135ac19c26779f6804baebe
```

## Solutions (Try in order)

### Solution 1: Use Expo Go (Recommended)
Instead of building native iOS, use Expo Go app on your phone:

```bash
cd frontend-mobile
npx expo start
```

Then scan the QR code with your phone's Expo Go app.

### Solution 2: Fix CocoaPods Cache
```bash
cd frontend-mobile/ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/CocoaPods
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
pod cache clean --all
pod deintegrate
pod setup
pod install
```

### Solution 3: Use Web Version
```bash
cd frontend-mobile
npx expo start --web
```

### Solution 4: Update React Native (if needed)
```bash
cd frontend-mobile
npx react-native upgrade
```

### Solution 5: Manual Boost Fix
Edit `ios/Podfile` and add this at the top:

```ruby
# Fix boost checksum issue
pod 'boost', :podspec => 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/react-native-community/boost-for-react-native/master/boost.podspec'
```

### Solution 6: Use Development Build
```bash
cd frontend-mobile
npx expo install expo-dev-client
npx expo run:ios --device
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend API running on port 8080
- ✅ Expo server running on port 8090  
- ✅ Integration tests passing (100% success rate)
- ❌ iOS native build failing (boost checksum issue)

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Use **Expo Go** for immediate testing
2. Test the app functionality with the working backend
3. Fix iOS build later if native features are needed
